# Types of Variables

In statistics, a **variable** is any characteristic that can take different values for different individuals or items.  
Variables are classified into two main types: **Quantitative** and **Qualitative**.  
Each type behaves differently and requires different methods of analysis.

## 1️⃣ Quantitative Variables

A **quantitative variable** is one that can be measured numerically.  
The values represent quantities — things you can add, subtract, or compare numerically.

Examples of quantitative variables:
- Age  
- Salary  
- Number of customers  
- Temperature  
- Stock price  

Quantitative variables are further divided into two types:

---

### 🔹 1. Discrete Variables

A **discrete variable** has countable values.  
You can list all possible values, and there are **no values in between**.

#### Examples:
- Number of students in a class (25, 26, 27…)
- Number of cars in a parking lot  
- Number of sales in a day  
- Number of defects on a product  

You can’t have **25.5 students** or **3.7 defective items** — these values must be whole numbers.

### 🔹 2. Continuous Variables

A **continuous variable** can take **any value within a range**, including decimals and fractions.

#### Examples:
- Height (170.4 cm, 171.2 cm)  
- Weight (70.15 kg, 70.16 kg)  
- Temperature (22.1°C, 22.15°C)  
- Time (1.52 seconds, 1.523 seconds)  

Between any two numbers, there are infinite possible values — making the variable continuous.

## 2️⃣ Qualitative (Categorical) Variables

A **qualitative** or **categorical variable** does **not** represent numerical values.  
Instead, it describes **categories, groups, or labels**.

Examples of qualitative variables:
- Gender (Male, Female)  
- Country (Italy, Egypt, France)  
- Customer satisfaction (Good, Average, Poor)  
- Car brand (BMW, Toyota, Ford)  

These values cannot be added or averaged because they are **not numeric**.

# Summary Table

| Variable Type | Meaning | Examples |
|---------------|---------|----------|
| **Quantitative** | Numerical values | Salary, age, stock price |
| **Discrete** | Countable values with no decimals | Number of students, number of cars |
| **Continuous** | Any value in a range, including decimals | Height, weight, temperature |
| **Qualitative (Categorical)** | Non-numeric categories | Gender, country, product type |

# Quick Real-World Examples

- The **number of trades executed today** → Discrete  
- The **price of a stock throughout the day** → Continuous  
- The **sector of a company** (e.g., Tech, Finance) → Qualitative  
- The **daily revenue** of a store → Quantitative
