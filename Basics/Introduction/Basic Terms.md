# Basic Terms in Statistics

Understanding basic statistical language is essential before analyzing or interpreting data.  
Below are the core terms, explained clearly with simple examples to make each concept easy to understand.

---

## 📌 Population
A **population** includes every individual or item that fits the criteria of a study.  
It is also called the **target population**.

### Example  
If you want to study the average income of people in Italy, then **all people living in Italy** form the population.

---

## 📌 Sample
A **sample** is a smaller group selected from the population to study.

### Example  
Instead of surveying all people in Italy, you might survey **1,000 randomly selected Italians**.  
These 1,000 people are the sample.

---

## 📌 Census vs Sample Survey

### **Census**
A **census** collects information from **every member** of the population.

**Example:**  
Italy's national population census collects data from **everyone** in the country.

### **Sample Survey**
A **sample survey** collects information from **a portion** of the population.

**Example:**  
A company surveys **200 customers** instead of all 50,000.  
This is a sample survey.

---

## 📌 Representative Sample
A **representative sample** accurately reflects the characteristics of the population.

### Example  
If 52% of the population is female and 48% male, a representative sample should reflect a similar distribution.  
This ensures fair and unbiased results.

---

## 📌 Random Sample
A **random sample** is selected so that each population member has a chance of being chosen.

### Simple Random Sample  
If every possible sample of the same size has the **same chance** of being selected, it is a **simple random sample**.

### Example  
If you randomly choose 100 students from a university of 10,000 students:

- Every student has a chance to be selected  
- Every group of 100 students has the same chance of being selected  

This makes it a simple random sample.

---

## 📌 Element or Member
An **element** (or member) is the specific subject or item from which data is collected.

### Example  
If you study salaries of employees in a company,  
each **employee** is an element.

---

## 📌 Variable
A **variable** is a characteristic that varies between elements.

### Examples  
- Age  
- Salary  
- Height  
- Country  
- Stock price  

A **constant**, by contrast, does not change.

---

## 📌 Observation or Measurement
An **observation** (or measurement) is the value of a variable for a specific element.

### Example  
If "age" is the variable and one employee is 29 years old,  
then **29** is the observation.

---

## 📌 Data Set
A **data set** is a collection of observations on one or more variables.

### Example  
If you collect the **age, salary, and department** for 200 employees,  
then all this collected information forms your data set.
