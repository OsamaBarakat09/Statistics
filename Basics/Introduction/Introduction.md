# 1️⃣ Types of Statistics

Statistics is divided into two main categories: **Descriptive Statistics** and **Inferential Statistics**.

---

## 📘 Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics summarize and describe data you already have.  
They do **not** make predictions — they only organize and present information.

### What descriptive statistics include:
- Tables  
- Graphs and charts  
- Measures like mean, median, maximum, minimum, standard deviation  

### Example  
Test scores of 10 students:

| Student | Score |
|---------|-------|
| A | 85 |
| B | 90 |
| C | 78 |
| D | 92 |
| E | 88 |
| F | 76 |
| G | 95 |
| H | 89 |
| I | 84 |
| J | 91 |

You can calculate:
- **Average score:** 86.8  
- **Highest score:** 95  
- **Lowest score:** 76  

---

## 📘 Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics use **sample data** to make conclusions or predictions about a **larger population**.

### What inferential statistics include:
- Estimating population values  
- Predicting future outcomes  
- Hypothesis testing  
- Confidence intervals  
- Regression analysis  

### Example  
A company tests **50 light bulbs** to estimate the average lifespan of all bulbs it manufactures.  
From this sample, they can estimate the lifespan of millions of bulbs.

# 2️⃣ Basic Terms in Statistics

Understanding basic terms is essential before performing any statistical analysis.

---

## 📌 Population
The entire group being studied.  
**Example:** All people living in Italy.

## 📌 Sample  
A portion of the population selected for study.  
**Example:** 1,000 Italians selected for a survey.

## 📌 Census  
Data collected from **every member** of the population.  
**Example:** National population census.

## 📌 Sample Survey  
Data collected from **part** of the population.  
**Example:** Asking 500 customers about their experience.

## 📌 Representative Sample  
A sample that closely reflects the population’s characteristics.  
**Example:** Gender distribution in the sample matches the population.

## 📌 Random Sample  
A sample selected so every member has a chance of being chosen.  
**Example:** Randomly choosing 100 students from a university.

## 📌 Simple Random Sample  
Every possible sample of the same size has the same chance of being chosen.

## 📌 Element / Member  
One individual or object from which data is collected.  
**Example:** One employee.

## 📌 Variable  
A characteristic that can change from one element to another.  
**Example:** Age, salary, height.

## 📌 Observation  
The value of a variable for an element.  
**Example:** If age is the variable, “29 years” is the observation.

## 📌 Data Set  
A collection of observations for one or more variables.

# 3️⃣ Types of Variables

Variables determine how data can be measured and analyzed.

---

## 1. Quantitative Variables  
These variables can be measured numerically.

### Examples:
- Salary  
- Height  
- Weight  
- Temperature  

### 🔹 Discrete Variables  
Values are **countable** and cannot take decimals.  
**Examples:**  
- Number of students  
- Number of cars  
- Number of products sold  

### 🔹 Continuous Variables  
Values can take **any number**, including decimals.  
**Examples:**  
- Weight (70.5 kg)  
- Height (172.3 cm)  
- Time (6.27 seconds)  

---

## 2. Qualitative (Categorical) Variables  
Variables that represent categories, not numbers.

### Examples:
- Gender (Male / Female)  
- Country (Italy / Egypt)  
- Department (HR / Finance / Marketing)  

These cannot be added or averaged because they are **not numeric**.

---

# 4️⃣ Types of Data: Cross-Section vs Time-Series

Understanding how data is collected helps determine the correct analysis method.

---

## 📌 Cross-Section Data  
Data collected from **different elements** at the **same point in time**.

### Example:  
Surveying 50 people **today** about their income.

Another example:

| Company | Revenue (2025) | Employees (2025) |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| A | 5M | 120 |
| B | 12M | 400 |
| C | 3M | 80 |

All data refers to **2025**, but comes from different companies → Cross-section.

---

## 📌 Time-Series Data  
Data collected from the **same element** across **multiple time points**.

### Example:  
Daily closing price of a stock for 10 days:

| Day | Closing Price |
|-----|----------------|
| Day 1 | 150 |
| Day 2 | 153 |
| Day 3 | 149 |
| Day 4 | 155 |
| Day 5 | 157 |
| Day 6 | 160 |
| Day 7 | 158 |
| Day 8 | 162 |
| Day 9 | 165 |
| Day 10 | 163 |

This tracks the same stock over time → Time-series.
