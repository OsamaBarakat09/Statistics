# Types of Statistics

Statistics is divided into two main categories: **Descriptive Statistics** and **Inferential Statistics**.  
Each category has a different purpose and helps us understand data in a different way.

## 1. Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics help you **summarize, organize, and display data**.  
They do **not** make predictions — they only describe what is currently in front of you.

### What descriptive statistics include:
- Tables  
- Charts and graphs  
- Measures like average, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation  

### Example

Imagine you collected test scores from 10 students:

| Student | Score |
|---------|-------|
| A | 85 |
| B | 90 |
| C | 78 |
| D | 92 |
| E | 88 |
| F | 76 |
| G | 95 |
| H | 89 |
| I | 84 |
| J | 91 |

Using descriptive statistics, we can say:

- The **average** score is **86.8**  
- The **highest** score is **95**  
- The **lowest** score is **76**  
- The **scores are mostly between 84 and 92**  
- A simple chart could show how the scores are distributed

These results only describe the group we already have — nothing more.

## 2. Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics help you **take a small sample of data** and use it to **make decisions or predictions** about a much larger group (the population).

### What inferential statistics include:
- Estimating population values  
- Predicting future outcomes  
- Testing ideas (hypothesis testing)  
- Confidence intervals  
- Regression and modeling  

### Example

A company tests **50 light bulbs** to estimate the average lifespan of all the bulbs it produces.

From this small sample, inferential statistics help them:

- Estimate the **average lifespan** of all their bulbs  
- Decide whether their production quality is good or needs improvement  
- Predict performance of future bulbs  
- Understand how certain they are about their estimate  

They are not describing the sample — they are using the sample to understand the **whole population**.

## Summary Table

| Type | What it does | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| **Descriptive Statistics** | Describes data you already have | Summarizing student test scores |
| **Inferential Statistics** | Uses a sample to make decisions or predictions about a population | Predicting average light bulb lifespan |
